# ASSIGNMENT 2

### Convolutional Neural Networks

In this Assignment we used Convolutional Neural Networks for the following -
* Classifying a subset of the `iNaturalist` dataset using models built from scratch as well as using pretrained models
* Doing Object Detection in an important life saving scenario

The assignment is divided into 3 parts - `PartA`, `PartB`, `PartC`.
