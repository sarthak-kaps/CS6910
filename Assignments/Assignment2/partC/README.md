### Idea and Explanation:

- Here, we used YOLOv3 algorithm to detect and display position of humans stuck under earthquake debris or drowning in tsunami.
- This application can be used in disaster management to aid the military by providing the live location of humans needing help.
- We used the pre-trained YOLOv3 model available on https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/â€‹.
- Also, we modified the code available on GitHub (https://github.com/nandinib1999/object-detection-yolo-opencv) to create this video.
