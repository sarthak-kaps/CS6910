1. 1952-1962 - The rise of ASR
	-> First Speech recognition software developed by Bell Laboratories called "Audrey" in 1952
	-> Ten years later, IBM introduced "Shoebox" , which understood and responded to 16 words in English.
	-> By the end of 60s, the technology could support words with 4 vowels and 9 consonants.

2. 1965-1975 - Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
	-> One of the breakthroughs came from a statistical method known as HMM.
	->  Instead of just using words and looking for sound patterns, the HMM estimated the probability of the unknown sounds actually being words.

3. 1990-2000 - Rise of machines
	-> With the advent of technology, CPUs became more powerful and allowed ASRs to reach next level.
	-> Softwares like Dragon Dictate came into existence which offered multi-thousand words and features like NLP.
	-> In 1997, same company introduced another software called Dragon NaturallySpeaking.

4. 2010-2012 - Voice search and assistants
	-> There weren't many great advancements until 2010, when SRI research developed SIRI.
	-> Then google voice search came out and many other great apps started getting developed.

5. 2016-2017 - Recent advancements
	-> IBM research acheived a word error rate of 6.9%.
	-> Microsoft later surpased it to 5.9%, which was again beaten by IBM to 5.5%
	-> However, Google claims to have the lowest rate of 4.9%.
